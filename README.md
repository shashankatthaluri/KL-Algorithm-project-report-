# 🎰 Multi-Armed Bandit Models 🎰
A literature review exploring the fascinating world of multi-armed bandit problems! 🤓

## 🤔 What is a Multi-Armed Bandit?
The multi-armed bandit model seeks to balance exploration (gathering information) and exploitation (maximizing reward) to solve sequential decision making problems. It has applications in recommendation systems, clinical trials 👨‍⚕️, and more!

## 📚 What This Project Covers
This literature review examines seminal papers on multi-armed bandits that advanced the field, including:
